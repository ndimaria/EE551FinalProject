# EE551FinalProject
This repository will contain code relevant to my EE551 Engineering Programming: Python class. 

## Description
For this project I intend on creating a stock quote tracker. This application will allow a user to enter a symbol for a stock that they are curious about the price. The program will return the price possibly within a GUI that will have a green or red arrow depending on if the price is up or down for that day. In addtion, a user will be able to select how often they want to be notified about the stock price. The application will then emit a pop up or message with the stock price for every specified amount of time that the user wants.
